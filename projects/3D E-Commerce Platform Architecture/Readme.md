## 3D E-Commerce AWS Architecture Project

This project is about designing a simple but powerful cloud architecture for a 3D e-commerce website using AWS. The goal was to show how the platform can stay available, scale for many users, load 3D models fast, stay secure, and remain cost-effective.

We used AWS services like Route 53, CloudFront, S3, EC2 Auto Scaling, Lambda, RDS, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, and Trusted Advisor. Each service plays a specific role in keeping the system fast, reliable, and secure:

## What we have on the project:

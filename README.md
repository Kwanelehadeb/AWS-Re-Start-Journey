# AWS re/Start 

Welcome! This repo contains my hands-on projects and labs from the *AWS re/Start program*. Each lab shows what I did, what I learned, and the challenges I faced along the way.

  - Each lab includes screenshots, a brief explanation, and reflections on challenges & solutions.
- *Service-Notes/* – Simple notes explaining AWS services in my own words.
- *Certificate/* – Place to add AWS re/Start certificate when available.

## Skills & Tools

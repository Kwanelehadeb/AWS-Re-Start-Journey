## Internet Protocols - Public and Private IP addresses
## Overview

This lab focuses on understanding the differences between public and private IP addresses and how they function within a network. You examine a customer scenario, analyze IP addressing behavior, and develop a solution to address the customer’s connectivity issue.

## Objectives

Summarize and investigate the customer scenario

Analyze the difference between private and public IP addresses

Develop a solution to the customer's issue

## Tasks Completed

Reviewed and summarized the customer’s network problem.

Identified whether the customer was using a public or private IP address.

Analyzed why the customer was unable to access certain services based on IP type.

Proposed a solution involving proper IP assignment, NAT usage, or routing adjustments.

## Challenges

Determining the exact cause of the customer's issue when multiple network factors were possible.

## Takeaways

Public IP addresses allow global internet communication, while private IPs are used only within internal networks.

NAT (Network Address Translation) is essential for enabling private networks to access the internet.

Troubleshooting IP-related issues requires understanding how devices communicate across network boundaries.

Effective communication and group analysis help reinforce networking concepts and real-world problem-solving.
